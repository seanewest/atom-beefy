## Cheesy
*A handy development tool that lets you run your browser-side JS without any html and in it's own window.*

#### Install
```
npm install -g seanewest/cheesy
```

#### Usage
```
cheesy entry.js [width] [height]
```
*Your JS will be placed inside a style tag in a generated html file with just a body. It will then be rendered in it's own window.*
