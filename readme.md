## Cheesy
*A handy development tool that lets you run your browser-side JS without any html and in it's own window.*

#### Install
First install [atom-shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell) (go to the **downloads** section). This allows you to run browser-side javascript on your desktop.

Then install cheesy:
```
npm install -g seanewest/cheesy
```

#### Usage
```
cheesy entry.js [width] [height]
```
*Your JS will be placed inside a style tag in a generated html file with just a body. It will then be rendered in it's own window.*
